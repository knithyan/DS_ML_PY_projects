# Welcome to my Data Science/Machine Learning Project Repository!

This repository contains my DS/ML and other projects scripted using Python.

## Machine-Learning-Models

1. Support Vector Machines (SVM) model to predict flower species based on image features.
Analyzed publicly available Iris Flower image dataset from Kaggle and created a Support Vector Machines model to classify flower species based on image features. Used GridSearch to tune model features and boost model accuracy.

2. Random Forest model to predict loan repayment. 
Analyzed publicly available LendingClub.com dataset from Kaggle and created a Random Forest model to predict loan repayment, that employs dummy variables to allow categorical features.

3. Deep Learning Neural Net to indicate whether a bank note was authentic.
Analyzed the Bank Authentication dataset from the UCI repository

4. Natural Language Processing to predict Rating.
Using the Yelp review dataset from Kaggle, created a Classifier for Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.

5. Linear Regression Model to provide business decision recommendations.
Analyzed customer sales data for a global E-commerce company based in NYC selling clothing online. Created a linear regression model and provided recommendations on mobile vs website development to boost sales.


# Other Python Projects

1. Tic-Tac-Toe game using nested statements.
